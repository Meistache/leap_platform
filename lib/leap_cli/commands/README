This directory contains ruby source files that define the available sub-
commands of the `leap` executable.

For example, the command:

  leap compile

Lives in lib/leap_cli/commands/init.rb

These files use a DSL (called GLI) for defining command suites.
See https://github.com/davetron5000/gli for more information.
