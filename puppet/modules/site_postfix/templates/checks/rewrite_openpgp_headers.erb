# This will replace the OpenPGP header that the client adds, because it is
# sometimes incorrect (due to the client not always knowing what the proper URL
# is for the webapp).
# e.g. This will rewrite this header:
# OpenPGP: id=4C0E01CD50E2F653; url="https://leap.se/key/elijah"; preference="signencrypt
# with this replacement:
# OpenPGP: id=4C0E01CD50E2F653; url="https://user.leap.se/key/elijah"; preference="signencrypt
#
# Note: whitespace in the pattern is represented by [[:space:]] to avoid these warnings from postmap:
# "record is in "key: value" format; is this an alias file?" and "duplicate entry"
